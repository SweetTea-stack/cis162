  <h2>Jaslen Garcia</h2>
  <p>My name is Jaslen but I go by Jazz. I am a sister of 5 girls and I am the care-giver of my youngest sibling who is 10 years old and has down-syndrome. <br>
  I dropped out of college during the beginning of COV-ID to help my youngest sibling with home schooling. It was not easy but it was a life learning experience and it has brought my family closer.
  <br> I am happy to be back in college and continue to further my education.</p>
  <h1>When I have free time</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>I enjoy being around nature.</li>
      <li>I enjoy spending time with my family</li>
      <li>I enjoy walks with my 3 poodle mixes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/letter-p.html">mathisfun</a> because Math is Fun =) </p>
